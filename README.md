**Code Study: 24 Hour Analog Clock and 24 Hour Digital Clock.**

- This is a project I did so that I can further my understanding in JavaScript.
- I referenced this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlAw_kd2608 so that I would know 
how to make the clock function.
- I added more onto it like adding a 24 Hour Digital Clock in addition and adding my name in, and also making the project responsive so that it would still look nice on phone screens.

**Other Reason Why I Decided to Make This Project**

- I've always wanted to own a 24 hour analog clock, but it's hard to find in physical stores. 
Even online, I couldn't find any. So, I wanted to make my own so that I can gaze at it, 
because I have a hard time registering how much time I have in a day to do things.

- I also added a 24 hour digital clock in there as an extra because even I get lazy reading
an analog clock. Also because I confused myself a bit trying to read the analog clock, due 
to its 24 hour format and me not being used to reading an analog clock in 24 hour format.
It's slightly challenging to read the minutes. But I think I'll get used to it eventually.
